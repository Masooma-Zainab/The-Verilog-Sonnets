# The-Verilog-Sonnets
A curated collection of digital designs—testbenches, architectures, and playful abstractions. This is engineering as literature: each module a paragraph, each waveform a feeling.

## 🌸 What is this?

This is not just hardware —  
It’s a tiny Verilog design shaped like a **heartbeat**.  
It models a 2-bit heart that grows stronger with each rising clock edge...  
unless a reset returns it to stillness.

A metaphor in logic gates.
